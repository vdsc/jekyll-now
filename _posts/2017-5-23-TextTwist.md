Built a stack word game where the user is tested for his vocabulary skills by identifying words from a jumbled letter rack.

### Features

* This project is called a Text Twist Game. The game is developed using PHP, Javascript and HTML. A scrabble.sqlite file is used as a dictionary for this game. 

* The user is provided a jumbled 6 letter word and the user then tries to find out the sub words or the 6 letter word from that jumbled rack. A score and timer is maintained too. If the user finds the 6 letter word, he/she is able to proceed to the next round or else the game is over when the time finishes.
    A 6 letter rack is generated by a get_six_letter_word() function in the php file. A random word is picked up from the dictionary whose length is 6. We generate sub words from that 6 letter word and then send it to the Javascript. The idea is to send the 6 letter word and its sub words so there we do not make requests to php again and again. 
    Whenever the user clicks on “twist”, I shuffle the six letter word. There are two ways to enter the word: one is by clicking on the letters and the other is by typing in the text box. 

* The project can be run on cloud9 environment(Apache, PHP5 web server).

* My “a-ha moment” was when I thought of displaying an alert when the user closes the browser or the tab. The alert would say if he/she really wants to quit the game. We implemented that but found some errors. My idea is to give a user an option to save game for future as I wanted to implement local storage/cookies/sessions.

* I wish to make the front end more interactive. I actually started working on implementing local storage but due to time shortage I could not complete it. I will be working on it for the purpose of learning more.
