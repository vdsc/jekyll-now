title: RBAC Forum on MEAN Stack!
---


Role-based access control forum built on Node.js. Only admin could CRUD topics and posts, a generic user had to login to comment. Designed the front-end framework using AngularJS and MongoDB as database.

* Our project is about building a role based access control forum. It includes various topics with its posts and comments. A user can post in a forum and also comment. A user can also create a topic in the forum.

* The project can be run on cloud 9. To run it you will need to start the mongodb by ‘mongod_start” and then 'npm start'.

* view the bash commands: cat ~/.bash_aliases

* It was a challenging project for me. I learnt angular js. Working with a new framework is definitely a complex thing to do for the first time. I would like to learn more angular js, html, css.
